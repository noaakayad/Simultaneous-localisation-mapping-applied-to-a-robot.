# Robot and Mapping Project

This project implements an autonomous robot capable of capturing points on a map, moving towards these points, following walls, and generating a map based on its movements. The captured points are stored in a list and then used to guide the robot's actions, such as moving towards the closest point or following walls.

## Features

- **Point Capture**: The robot captures points during its movement and stores them in a list.
- **Robot Movement**: The robot automatically moves towards the closest point it has found.
- **Wall Following**: The robot can follow a wall by tracing a path determined by the captured points.
- **Map Generation**: The robot generates a map from the captured points and movements and saves it as an image.
- **Point List Transformation**: The captured points are converted from `float` to `int` for use in map creation.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure to install the following libraries:
- **Adafruit_Image**: For handling and manipulating images.
- **Adafruit_SD**: For working with the SD card and saving images.
- **Assert.h**: For handling assertions in the code.
